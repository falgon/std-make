Product types: about structured binding and tuple-like access
=============================================================

# Abstract

This paper proposes to change the customization points of structured binding to something more specific and related to product types: `product_type_size` and  `product_type_get` either as members or non-members found by ADL.

In addition, it proposes to add some product type specific operators to get the size and the n<sup>th</sup> element as well as some specific traits and functions.

The wording has been modified so that both structured binding and product type access wording doesn't repeat themselves.


# Motivation

## Status-quo

[P0144R2] proposes the ability to bind all the members of a *extended tuple-like* type at a time via the new structured binding statement which has some primitive matching for some specific cases and let the user customize their types using the case 2 with the current ad-hoc *tuple-like* interface.

[P0144R2] case 1 takes care of c-array (wondering if we cannot define already a *tuple-like* access for them that can be found by ADL).

[P0144R2] case 3 support structured binding to bitfields as it does for any other non-static public member.

This means that with [P0144R2] we will be able to access the members of some *extended tuple-like* types that would not have *tuple-like* access. [P0197R0] proposes the generation of the *tuple-like* access function for simple structs as [P0144R2] does for simple structs (case 3 in [P0144R2]).  However we are unable to define the `get<N>(tl)` function to access bitfields. So we cannot have *tuple-like* access for all the types supported by [P0217R1]. This is unfortunately asymmetric. We want to have structured binding, pattern matching and *tuple-like* access for the same types.

This means that the *extended tuple-like* access cannot be limited to the current *tuple-like* customization points. We need something different.

In addition, [P0217R1] makes the language dependent on the customization point `std::tuple_size<T>`, which is defined in the library file `<utility>`. This file is not part of the freestanding implementation. We should avoid this kind of dependency as much as possible.

Adopting [P0144R2] as such would mean that

* we accept a dependency on the library file `<utility>`, and
* we would be unable to have *tuple-like* access for all the types covered by [P0144R2].

Accepting the previous points would at least mean that we need to change the freestanding implementation requirements and that the *extended tuple-like* access is based on the structured binding statement instead of the ad-hoc *tuple-like* access, and that we cannot access the size or the n<sup>th</sup> element directly and independently.

The authors consider that this is an acceptable situation, but would prefer to see what the committee thinks of an alternative design.

## Alternative design

Not accepting any of the previous points would mean a change on the definition of *tuple-like* access.

### Independence from library

In order to overcome the library dependency we need to find a way to avoid the use of `std::tuple_size<T>`. We have 3 possibilities:

* A non-member function `product_type_size` that must be found by ADL.
* A member function `product_type_size `.
* Use `product_type_get<N>(tpl)` as customization point and deduce the tuple size as N for which `product_type_get<I>(tpl)` is well defined for any I in 0..N(-1) and `product_type_get<N>(tpl)` is not defined.

#### non-member function `product_type_size`

We could think of a non-member function `product_type_size` that must be found by ADL. However `product_type_size<T>()` couldn't be found by ADL. We need to add the type on as a parameter. 

We could look for `product_type_size(T)` but this would be restricted to copyable types.
We could look for `product_type_size(T const&)` but this would accept types inheriting from `T`.
We could use a nullary function that returns a pointer to `T` and look for `product_type_size(T*(*)())`. This has the advantage that it doesn't accept derived types and works for any type.

#### member function `product_type_size`

This seems much simpler.

#### non-member function `product_type_get<I>(tpl)`

This also seems much simpler, but determining the size could be expensive at compile time.

### Ability to work with bitfields

To provide *extended tuple-like* access for all the types covered by [P0144R2] which support getting the size and the n<sup>th</sup> element, we need to define some kind of predefined operators `pt_size(T)`/`pt_get<N>(pt)` that could use the new *product type* customization points. The use of operators, as opposed to pure library functions, is particularly required to support bitfield members.

### Parameter packs

We shouldn't forget parameter packs, which could be seen as being similar to product types. Parameter packs already have the `sizeof...(T)` operator. Some (see e.g. [P0311R0] and references therein) are proposing to have a way to explicitly access the n<sup>th</sup> element of a pack (a variety of possible syntaxes have been suggested). The authors believe that the same operators should apply to parameter packs and product types.

# Proposal

This paper proposes to define a new *product type* access, to cover the previous *extended tuple-like* access, on which [P0144R2] would be based. The user shall be able to customize his own types to see them as *product types* ([P0144R2] case 2).

The *product type* access is based on two operators: one `pt_size(T)` to get the size and the other `pt_get<N>(pt)` to get the `N`<sup>th</sup> element of a product type instance `pt` of type `T`. The definition of these operators is based on the wording of structured binding [P0217R1].

The user should of course, be able to customize his *product* types, as she already is able to do it for *tuple-like* types, but now it should define the member operations `product_type_size()` and `product_type_get<N>()`.

The name of the operators `pt_size` and `pt_get` are of course subject to bike-shedding.
This paper proposes the following names for the operators and the customization operations:

* `pt_size(PT)` = `product_type_size(PT)`
* `pt_get<N>(pt)` = `product_type_get<N>(pt)`

Customization points are functions with the same name as the operators:

* `PT::pt_size()` = `PT::product_type_size()`
* `pt.pt_get<N>()` = `pt.product_type_get<N>()`
* `pt.pt_get<N>()` = `product_type_get<N>(pt)`

Note that `product_type_size` and `product_type_get` must therefore be contextual keywords.

But what would be the result type of those operators? While we can consider `product_type_size` as a function and we could say that it returns an `unsigned int`, `product_type_get<N>(pt)` wouldn't be a function (if we want to support bitfields), and so `decltype(product_type_get<N>(pt))` wouldn't be defined if the N<sup>th</sup> element is a bitfield managed on [P0144R2] case 3. In all the other cases we can define it depending on the const-rvalue nature of `pt`.

The following could be syntactic sugar for those operators but we don't proposes them yet, waiting to see what we do with parameter packs direct access and sum types.

* `pt_size(PT)` = `sizeof...(PT)`
* `pt_get<N>(pt)` = `pt.[N]`

## Caveats

`sizeof(T)`, `pt_size(T)` and `pt_get<N>(pt)` are not functions, and so they cannot be used in any algorithm expecting a function. Generic algorithms working on *product* types should take the type as a template parameter and possibly an integral constant for the indices.

### Library interface

However, an alternative is to define generic functions `std::product_type::size<T>()` and `std::product_type::get<I>(pt)`.

We have two possibilities for `std::product_type::get`: either it supports bitfield elements and we need a `std::bitfield_ref` type, or it doesn't supports them.

We believe that we should provide the `bitfield_ref` class in the future, but it seems it is too late to propose such a class for C++17.

However, we could already define the functions that will work well expect for bitfields.

```c++
namespace std {
namespace product_type {

template <class PT>
constexpr size_t size() { return product_type_size(PT); }

template <size_t N, class PT>
constexpr auto get(PT&& pt) { return product_type_get(N, forward<PT>(pt)); } // Wouldn't work for bitfields

}}
```

This means that in C++17 we could work with product types using the operators, and that we wouldn't have a complete function interface until C++20. While this could be seen as a limitation, and it would be in some cases, a lot of algorithms can be defined using the operator interfaces without any limitation. Only some algorithms would need the function interface.

Users could already define their own `bitfield_ref` class in C++17 and define its customization point for bitfields members if needed. However, the default implementation of the `pt_get` operator would never return a bitfield_reference. In order to define this function in C++20 we will need a compiler type trait `product_type_element_is_bitfield<N,PT>` that would say if the N<sup>th</sup> element is a bitfield or not.

```c++
namespace std {
namespace product_type {

template <class PT>
size_t size() { return product_type_size(PT); }

template <size_t N, class PT>
// requires product_type_element_is_bitfield<N,PT>::value
bitfield_ref_t<PT, N> get(PT&& pt) { return bitfield_ref_t<PT, N>(pt); } 

template <size_t N, class PT>
// requires ! product_type_element_is_bitfield<N,PT>::value
auto get(PT&& pt) { return product_type_get(N, forward<PT>(pt)); }

}}
```

# Wording

## Product types terms

A type `E` is a *product type* if the following terms are well defined.

*product type size*

* If E is an array type with element type T, equal to the number of elements of E.
* Else, if the expression `e.product_type_size()` is a well-formed integral constant expression, equal to `e.product_type_size()`.
* Else, if all of E's non-static data members and bit-fields shall be public direct members of E or of the same unambiguous public base class of E, E shall not have an anonymous union member, equal to the number of non-static data members of E. 
* Else it is undefined.

*product type i <sup>th</sup>-element* 

* If the *product type size* of `E` is defined and `i` is less than the *product type size* of `E`.
    * If `E` is an array type with element type `T`, equal to `e[i]`.
    * Else, if the expression `e.product_type_size()` is a well-formed integral constant expression, equal to the following: The unqualified-id `product_type_get` is looked up in the scope of `E` by class member access lookup (3.4.5 [basic.lookup.classref]), and if that finds at least one declaration, the value is `e.product_type_get<i-1>()`. Otherwise, the value is `product_type_get<i-1>(e)`, where `product_type_get` is looked up in the associated namespaces (3.4.2 [basic.lookup.argdep]). [ Note: Ordinary unqualified lookup (3.4.1 [basic.lookup.unqual]) is not performed. -- end note ].
    * else, if all of `E`'s non-static data members and bit-fields shall be public direct members of `E` or of the same unambiguous public base class of `E`, `E` shall not have an anonymous union member, equal to  `e.mi` where `i`-th non-static data member of `E` in declaration order is designated by `mi`. 
    * Else it is undefined.
* Else it is undefined.


**Defines the following operators**

*TBC*


**In 7.1.6.4 [dcl.spec.auto] paragraph 8 of the Structured Binding proposal, replace**

If `E` is an array type with element type `T`, the number of elements in the identifier-list shall be equal to the number of elements of `E`. Each `v`<sub>`i`</sub> is the name of an lvalue that refers to the element `i-1` of the array and whose type is `T`; the referenced type is `T`. [ Note: The top-level cv-qualifiers of `T` are cv. -- end note ]

Otherwise, if the expression `std::tuple_size<E>::value` is a well-formed integral constant expression, the number of elements in the identifier-list shall be equal to the value of that expression. The unqualified-id `get` is looked up in the scope of `E` by class member access lookup (3.4.5 [basic.lookup.classref]), and if that finds at least one declaration, the initializer is `e.get<i-1>()`. Otherwise, the initializer is `get<i-1>(e)`, where `get` is looked up in the associated namespaces (3.4.2 [basic.lookup.argdep]). [ Note: Ordinary unqualified lookup (3.4.1 [basic.lookup.unqual]) is not performed. -- end note ] In either case, `e` is an lvalue if the type of the entity `e` is an lvalue reference and an xvalue otherwise. Given the type `T`<sub>`i`</sub> designated by `std::tuple_element<i-1,E>::type`, each `v`<sub>`i`</sub> is a variable of type "reference to `T`<sub>`i`</sub>" initialized with the initializer, where the reference is an lvalue reference if the initializer is an lvalue and an rvalue reference otherwise; the referenced type is `T`<sub>`i`</sub>.

Otherwise, all of `E`'s non-static data members and bit-fields shall be public direct members of `E` or of the same unambiguous public base class of `E`, `E` shall not have an anonymous union member, and the number of elements in the identifier-list shall be equal to the number of non-static data members of `E`. The `i`-th non-static data member of `E` in declaration order is designated by `m`<sub>`i`</sub>. Each `v`<sub>`i`</sub> is the name of an lvalue that refers to the member `m`<sub>`i`</sub> of `e` and whose type is cv `T`<sub>`i`</sub>, where `T`<sub>`i`</sub> is the declared type of that member; the referenced type is cv `T`<sub>`i`</sub>. The lvalue is a bit-field if that member is a bit-field.

**with**

The number of elements in the identifier-list shall be equal to *product type size of `E`*.

Each `v`<sub>`i`</sub> is the name of an lvalue that refers to *product type `i`<sup>th</sup>-element of `e`*.


## Library

### Product type object

In `<product_type>`

```c++
namespace std {
namespace product_type {

template <class PT>
constexpr size_t size() { return product_type_size(PT); }

template <size_t N, class PT>
constexpr auto get(PT&& pt) { return product_type_get(N, forward<PT>(pt)); } 

}}
```


#### `product_type::size`


```c++
template <class PT>
static constexpr size_t size();
```

*Effect*: As if `return` *product type size* `PT`.

*Remark*: This operation would not be defined if *product type size* `PT`. is undefined.

#### `product_type::get`


```c++
template <size_t N, class PT>
constexpr auto get(PT&& pt);
```

*Requires*: `N < size<PT>()`

*Effect*: As if `return` *product type Nth-element* of `pt`.

*Remark*: This operation would not be defined if *product type Nth-element* of `pt` is undefined.




### std::tuple

**Add the associated customization**

```c++
template <class ...Ts>
class tuple {
    ...
    constexpr size_t product_type_size() { return sizeof...(Ts); };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() { return get<I>(*this); };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() const { return get<I>(*this); };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() && { return get<I>(*this); };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() const && { return get<I>(*this); };
};
```

### std::array

**Add the associated customization**

```c++
template <class T, size_t N>
class array {
    ...
    constexpr size_t product_type_size() { return N; };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() { return get<I>(*this); };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() const { return get<I>(*this); };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() && { return get<I>(*this); };
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto product_type_get() const && { return get<I>(*this); };
};
```

# Implementability

There is no implementation as of the date of this paper.

# Open Questions

The authors would like to have an answer to the following points if there is any interest at all in this proposal:

* Do we want the customization points for `PRODUCT_TYPE_SIZE` to be `PT::product_type_size()`?
* Do we want the customization points for `PRODUCT_TYPE_GET` to be `pt.product_type_get<i>()`/`product_type_size<I>(pt)`?
* Do we want the `PRODUCT_TYPE_SIZE`/`PRODUCT_TYPE_GET` macros?
* Do we want the `product_type_size`/`product_type_get` operators?
* Do we want the `std::product_type::size`/`std::product_type::get` functions?

# Future work

## Allow product type function access to bitfield references

## Extend the default definition to aggregates

With [P0017R1] we have now that we can consider classes with non-virtual public base classes as aggregates. 
[P0197R0] considers the elements of the base class as elements of the *tuple-like* type.
I would expect that all the aggregates can be seen as *tuple-like* types, so we need surely to consider this case in [P0217R1] and [P0197R0].

We should see aggregate initialization and structured binding almost as inverse operations.

This could already be the case for predefined *tuple-like* types which will have aggregate initialization. However user defined *tuple-like* types would need to define the corresponding constructor.
