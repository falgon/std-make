# Utility class to represent expected object
============================================

 
**Abstract**

Class template `expected<T, E>` is a *vocabulary type* which contains an expected
value of type `T`, or an error `E`. The class skews towards behaving like a `T`,
because its intended use is when the expected type is contained. When something
unexpected occurs, more typing is required. When all is good, code mostly looks
as if a `T` were being handled.

# Introduction

Class template `expected<T, E>` contains either:

* A value of type `T`, the expected value type; or
* A value of type `E`, an error type used when an unexpected outcome occured.

The interface can be queried as to whether the underlying value is the expected
value (of type `T`) or an unexpected value (of type `E`). The original idea
comes from Andrei Alexandrescu C++ and Beyond 2012: Systematic Error Handling in
C++ [Alexandrescu.Expected]. The interface and the rational are based on
`std::optional` [N3793]. We consider `expected<T, E>` as a supplement to
`optional<T>`, expressing why an expected value isn't contained in the object.

[P0262R0] is a related proposal for status / optional value. [P0157R0] describes
when to use each of the different error report mechanism.


# Motivation

C++'s two main error mechanisms are exceptions and return codes. Characteristics
of a good error mechanism are:

1. **Error visibility**: Failure cases should appear throughout the code review:
   debugging can be painful if errors are hidden.
2. **Information on errors**: Errors should carry information from their origin,
   causes and possibly the ways to resolve it.
3. **Clean code**: Treatment of errors should be in a separate layer of code and
   as invisible as possible. The reader could notice the presence of exceptional
   cases without needing to stop reading.
4. **Non-Intrusive error** Errors should not monopolize the communication
   channel dedicated to normal code flow. They must be as discrete as
   possible. For instance, the return of a function is a channel that should not
   be exclusively reserved for errors.

The first and the third characteristic seem contradictory and deserve further
explanation. The former points out that errors not handled should appear clearly
in the code. The latter tells us that error handling must not interfere with the
legibility, meaning that it clearly shows the normal execution flow. Here is a
comparison between the exception and return codes:

| | Exception | Return error code |
|-|-----------|-------------------|
| **Visibility** | Not visible without further analysis of the code. However, if an exception is thrown, we can follow the stack trace. | Visible at the first sight by watching the prototype of the called function. However ignoring return code can lead to undefined results and it can be hard to figure out the problem. |
| **Informations** | Exceptions can be arbitrarily rich. | Historically a simple integer. Nowadays, the header `<system_error>` provides richer error code. |
| **Clean code** | Provides clean code, exceptions can be completely invisible for the caller. | Force you to add, at least, a `if` statement after each function call. |
| **Non-Intrusive** | Proper communication channel. | Monopolization of the return channel. |


## Expected class

We can do the same analysis for the `expected<T, E>` class and observe the
advantages over the classic error reporting systems.

1. **Error visibility**: It takes the best of the exception and error code. It's
   visible because the return type is `expected<T, E>` and users cannot ignore
   the error case if they want to retrieve the contained value.
2. **Information**: Arbitrarily rich.
3. **Clean code**: The monadic interface of `expected` provides a framework
   delegating the error handling to another layer of code. Note that
   `expected<T, E>` can also act as a bridge between an exception-oriented code
   and a nothrow world.
4. **Non-Intrusive** Use the return channel without monopolizing it.

Other notable characteristics of `expected<T, E>` include:

* Associates errors with computational goals.
* Naturally allows multiple errors inflight.
* Teleportation possible.
* Across thread boundaries.
* On weak executors which don't support thread-local storage.
* Across no-throw subsystem boundaries.
* Across time: save now, throw later.
* Collect, group, combine errors.
* Much simpler for a compiler to optimize.

# Use cases

## Safe division

This example shows how to define a safe divide operation checking for
divide-by-zero conditions. Using exceptions, we might write something like this:

```c++
struct DivideByZero : public std::exception {...};
double safe_divide(double i, double j)
{
    if (j == 0) throw DivideByZero();
    else return i / j;
}
```

With `expected<T, E>`, we are not required to use exceptions, we can use
`std::errc` which is easier to introspect than `std::exception_ptr` if we want
to use the error. For the purpose of this example, we use the following
enumeration:

```c++
enum class arithmetic_errc
{
    divide_by_zero, // 9 / 0 == ?
    not_integer_division, // 5 / 2 == 2.5 (which is not an integer)
    integer_divide_overflows, // INT_MIN / -1
};
```

Using `expected<double, errc>`, the code becomes:

```c++
expected<double, errc> safe_divide(double i, double j)
{
    if (j == 0) return unexpected(arithmetic_errc::divide_by_zero); // (1)
    else return i / j; // (2)
}
```

Note (1) the implicit conversion from `unexpected<E>` to `expected<T, E>` and
(2) from `T` to `expected<T, E>` avoid boilerplate code. We have a clean way to
fail without using the exception machinery, and we can give precise information
about why it failed as well. The liability is that this function is going to be
tedious to use. For instance, the exception-based function `i + j / k` is:

```c++
double f1(double i, double j, double k)
{
    return i + safe_divide(j,k);
}

```
but becomes using `expected<double, errc>`:

```c++
expected<double, errc> f1(double i, double j, double k)
{
    auto q = safe_divide(j, k);
    if (q) return i + *q;
    else return q;
}
```

We can use `expected<T, E>` to represent different error conditions. For
instance, with integer division, we might want to fail if there's overflow, or
if the two numbers are not evenly divisible, as well as checking for division by
zero. We can overload our `safe_divide` function accordingly:

```c++
expected<int, errc> safe_divide(int i, int j)
{
    if (j == 0) return unexpected(arithmetic_errc::divide_by_zero);
    if (i == INT_MIN && j == -1) return unexpected(arithmetic_errc::integer_divide_overflows);
    if (i % j != 0) return unexpected(arithmetic_errc::not_integer_division);
    else return i / j;
}
```


## URL parsing

The following is how WebKit-based browsers [parse URLs] and use `std::expected`
to denote failure:

```c++
template<typename CharacterType>
std::expected<uint32_t, URLParser::IPv4PieceParsingError>
URLParser::parseIPv4Piece(CodePointIterator<CharacterType>& iterator, bool& didSeeSyntaxViolation)
{
    enum class State : uint8_t { UnknownBase, Decimal, OctalOrHex, Octal, Hex };
    State state = State::UnknownBase;
    wtf::checked<uint32_t, RecordOverflow> value = 0; // A class for security-critical checked arithmetic.
    if (!iterator.atEnd() && *iterator == '.')
        return std::make_unexpected(IPv4PieceParsingError::Failure);
    while (!iterator.atEnd()) {
        if (isTabOrNewline(*iterator)) {
            didSeeSyntaxViolation = true;
            ++iterator;
            continue;
        }
        if (*iterator == '.') {
            assert(!value.hasOverflowed());
            return value.unsafeGet();
        }
        switch (state) {
        case State::UnknownBase:
            if (*iterator == '0') {
                ++iterator;
                state = State::OctalOrHex;
                break;
            }
            state = State::Decimal;
            break;
        case State::OctalOrHex:
            didSeeSyntaxViolation = true;
            if (*iterator == 'x' || *iterator == 'X') {
                ++iterator;
                state = State::Hex;
                break;
            }
            state = State::Octal;
            break;
        case State::Decimal:
            if (!isASCIIDigit(*iterator))
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4PieceParsingError::Failure);
            value *= 10;
            value += *iterator - '0';
            if (value.hasOverflowed())
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4PieceParsingError::Overflow);
            ++iterator;
            break;
        case State::Octal:
            assert(didSeeSyntaxViolation);
            if (*iterator < '0' || *iterator > '7')
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4PieceParsingError::Failure);
            value *= 8;
            value += *iterator - '0';
            if (value.hasOverflowed())
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4PieceParsingError::Overflow);
            ++iterator;
            break;
        case State::Hex:
            assert(didSeeSyntaxViolation);
            if (!isASCIIHexDigit(*iterator))
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4PieceParsingError::Failure);
            value *= 16;
            value += toASCIIHexValue(*iterator);
            if (value.hasOverflowed())
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4PieceParsingError::Overflow);
            ++iterator;
            break;
        }
    }
    assert(!value.hasOverflowed());
    return value.unsafeGet();
}
```

These results are then accumulated in a `vector`, and different failure
conditions are handled differently. An important fact to internalize is that the
first failure encountered isn't necessarily the one which is returned, which is
why exceptions aren't a good solution here: parsing must continue.

```c++
template<typename CharacterTypeForSyntaxViolation, typename CharacterType>
std::expected<URLParser::IPv4Address, URLParser::IPv4ParsingError>
URLParser::parseIPv4Host(const CodePointIterator<CharacterTypeForSyntaxViolation>& iteratorForSyntaxViolationPosition, CodePointIterator<CharacterType> iterator)
{
    std::vector<std::expected<uint32_t, URLParser::IPv4PieceParsingError>> items;
    bool didSeeSyntaxViolation = false;
    if (!iterator.atEnd() && *iterator == '.')
        return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::NotIPv4);
    while (!iterator.atEnd()) {
        if (isTabOrNewline(*iterator)) {
            didSeeSyntaxViolation = true;
            ++iterator;
            continue;
        }
        if (items.size() >= 4)
            return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::NotIPv4);
        items.append(parseIPv4Piece(iterator, didSeeSyntaxViolation));
        if (!iterator.atEnd() && *iterator == '.') {
            ++iterator;
            if (iterator.atEnd())
                syntaxViolation(iteratorForSyntaxViolationPosition);
            else if (*iterator == '.')
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::NotIPv4);
        }
    }
    if (!iterator.atEnd() || !items.size() || items.size() > 4)
        return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::NotIPv4);
    for (const auto& item : items) {
        if (!item.hasValue() && item.error() == IPv4PieceParsingError::Failure)
            return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::NotIPv4);
    }
    for (const auto& item : items) {
        if (!item.hasValue() && item.error() == IPv4PieceParsingError::Overflow)
            return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::Failure);
    }
    if (items.size() > 1) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < items.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (items[i].value() > 255)
                return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::Failure);
        }
    }
    if (items[items.size() - 1].value() >= pow256(5 - items.size()))
        return std::make_unexpected(IPv4ParsingError::Failure);

    if (didSeeSyntaxViolation)
        syntaxViolation(iteratorForSyntaxViolationPosition);
    for (const auto& item : items) {
        if (item.value() > 255)
            syntaxViolation(iteratorForSyntaxViolationPosition);
    }

    if (items.size() != 4)
        syntaxViolation(iteratorForSyntaxViolationPosition);

    IPv4Address ipv4 = items.takeLast().value();
    for (size_t counter = 0; counter < items.size(); ++counter)
        ipv4 += items[counter].value() * pow256(3 - counter);
    return ipv4;
}
```

Note that the above code uses `std::make_unexpected` because WebKit still uses
C++14. A C++17 codebase would use deduction guides and `std::unexpected`
directly.


## Error retrieval and correction

The major advantage of `expected<T, E>` over `optional<T>` is the ability to
transport an error. Programmer do the following when a function call returns an
error:

1. Ignore it.
2. Delegate the responsibility of error handling to higher layer.
3. Try to resolve the error.
 
Because the first behavior might lead to buggy application, we ignore the
usecase. The handling is dependent of the underlying error type, we consider the
`exception_ptr` and the `errc` types.

A first imperative way to use our error is to simply extract it from the
`expected` using the `error()` member function. The following example shows a
`divide2` function that return `0` if the error is `divide_by_zero`:

```c++
int divide2(int i, int j)
{
    auto e = safe_divide(i, j);
    if (!e)
        switch (e.error().value()) {
        case arithmetic_errc::divide_by_zero: return 0;
        case arithmetic_errc::not_integer_division: return i / j; // Ignore.
        case arithmetic_errc::integer_divide_overflows: return INT_MIN;
        // No default! Adding a new enum value causes a compiler warning here,
        // forcing an update of the code.
        }
    return *e;
}
```
 
# Impact on the standard

These changes are entirely based on library extensions and do not require any
language features beyond what is available in C++17.

# Design rationale 

The same rationale described in [N3672] for `optional<T>` applies to
`expected<T, E>` and `expected<T, nullopt_t>` should behave almost the same as
`optional<T>` (though we advise using `optional` in that case). The following
sections presents the rationale in [N3672] applied to `expected<T, E>`.

## Conceptual model of `expected<T, E>`

`expected<T, E>` models a discriminated union of types `T` and
`unexpected<E>`. `expected<T, E>` is viewed as a value of type `T` or value of
type `unexpected<E>`, allocated in the same storage, along with observers to
determine which of the two it is.

The interface in this model requires operations such as comparison to `T`,
comparison to `E`, assignment and creation from either. It is easy to determine
what the value of the expected object is in this model: the type it stores (`T`
or `E`) and either the value of `T` or the value of `E`.

Additionally, within the affordable limits, we propose the view that
`expected<T, E>` extends the set of the values of `T` by the values of type
`E`. This is reflected in initialization, assignment, ordering, and equality
comparison with both `T` and `E`. In the case of `optional<T>`, `T` cannot be a
`nullopt_t`. As the types `T` and `E` could be the same in `expected<T, E>`,
there is need to tag the values of `E` to avoid ambiguous expressions. The
`unexpected(E)` deduction guide is proposed for this purpose. However `T` cannot
be `unexpected<E>` for a given `E`.

```c++
expected<int, string> ei = 0;
expected<int, string> ej = 1;
expected<int, string> ek = unexpected(string());

ei = 1;
ej = unexpected(E());;
ek = 0;

ei = unexpected(E());;
ej = 0;
ek = 1;
```

## Default `E` template paremeter type

At the Toronto meeting LEWG decided against having a default `E` template
parameter type (`std::error_code` or other). This prevents us from providing an
`expected` deduction guides for error construction which is a *good thing*: an
error was **not** expected, a `T` was expected, it's therefore sensible to force
spelling out unexpected outcomes when generating them.

## Initialization of `expected<T, E>`

In cases where `T` and `E` have value semantic types capable of storing `n` and
`m` distinct values respectively, `expected<T, E>` can be seen as an extended
`T` capable of storing `n + m` values: these `T` and `E` stores. Any valid
initialization scheme must provide a way to put an expected object to any of
these states. In addition, some `T`s aren't `CopyConstructible` and their
expected variants still should be constructible with any set of arguments that
work for `T`.

As in [N3672], the model retained is to initialize either by providing an
already constructed `T` or a tagged `E`. The default constructor required `T` to
be default-constructible (since `expected<T>` should behave like `T` as much as
possible).

```c++
string s"STR";

expected<string, errc> es{s}; // requires Copyable<T>
expected<string, errc> et = s; // requires Copyable<T>
expected<string, errc> ev = string"STR"; // requires Movable<T>

expected<string, errc> ew; // expected value
expected<string, errc> ex{}; // expected value
expected<string, errc> ey = {}; // expected value
expected<string, errc> ez = expected<string,errc>{}; // expected value
```

In order to create an unexpected object, the deduction guide `unexpected` needs
to be used:

```c++
expected<string, int> ep{unexpected(-1)}; // unexpected value, requires Movable<E>
expected<string, int> eq = unexpected(-1); // unexpected value, requires Movable<E>
```

As in [N3672], and in order to avoid calling move/copy constructor of `T`, we
use a “tagged” placement constructor:

```c++
expected<MoveOnly, errc> eg; // expected value
expected<MoveOnly, errc> eh{}; // expected value
expected<MoveOnly, errc> ei{in_place}; // calls MoveOnly{} in place
expected<MoveOnly, errc> ej{in_place, "arg"}; // calls MoveOnly{"arg"} in place
```

To avoid calling move/copy constructor of `E`, we use a “tagged” placement
constructor:

```c++
expected<int, string> ei{unexpect}; // unexpected value, calls string{} in place
expected<int, string> ej{unexpect, "arg"}; // unexpected value, calls string{"arg"} in place
```

An alternative name for `in_place` that is coherent with `unexpect` could be
`expect`. Being compatible with `optional<T>` seems more important. So this
proposal doesn't propose such an `expect` tag.

The alternative and also comprehensive initialization approach, which is
compatible with the default construction of `expected<T, E>` as `T()`, could
have been a variadic perfect forwarding constructor that just forwards any set
of arguments to the constructor of the contained object of type `T`.


## Never-empty guarantee

As for `boost::variant<T, unexpected<E>>`, `expected<T, E>` ensures that it is
never empty. All instances `v` of type `expected<T, E>` guarantee `v` has
constructed content of one of the types `T` or `E`, even if an operation on `v`
has previously failed.

This implies that `expected` may be viewed precisely as a union of exactly its
bounded types. This "never-empty" property insulates the user from the
possibility of undefined `expected` content or an `expected`
`valueless_by_exception` as `std::variant` and the significant additional
complexity-of-use attendant with such a possibility.

In order to ensure this property the types `T` and `E` must satisfy the
requirements as described in [P0110R0]. Given the nature of the parameter `E`,
that is, to transport an error, it is expected to be
`is_nothrow_copy_constructible<E>`, `is_nothrow_move_constructible<E>`,
`is_nothrow_copy_assignable<E>` and `is_nothrow_move_assignable<E>`.

Note however that these constraints are applied only to the operations that need
them.

If `is_nothrow_constructible<T, Args...>` is `false`, the `expected<T,
E>::emplace(Args...)` function is not defined. In this case, it is the
responsibility of the user to create a temporary and move or copy it.


## The default constructor

Similar data structure includes `optional<T>`, `variant<T1,...,Tn>` and
`future<T>`. We can compare how they are default constructed.

* `std::optional<T>` default constructs to an optional with no value.
* `std::variant<T1,...,Tn>` default constructs to `T1` if default constructible
  or it is ill-formed
* `std::future<T>` default constructs to an invalid future with no shared state
  associated, that is, no value and no exception.
* `std::optional<T>` default constructor is equivalent to
  `boost::variant<nullopt_t, T>`.

This raises several questions about `expected<T, E>`:

* Should the default constructor of `expected<T, E>` behave like `variant<T,
  unexpected<E>>` or as `variant<unexpected<E>,T>`?
* Should the default constructor of `expected<T, nullopt_t>` behave like
  `optional<T>`? If yes, how should behave the default constructor of
  `expected<T, E>`? As if initialized with `unexpected(E())`? This would be
  equivalent to the initialization of `variant<unexpected<E>,T>`.
* Should `expected<T, E>` provide a default constructor at all? [N3527] presents
  valid arguments against this approach, e.g. `array<expected<T, E>>` would not
  be possible.

Requiring `E` to be default constructible seems less constraining than requiring
`T` to be default constructible (e.g. consider the `Date` example in
[N3527]). With the same semantics `expected<Date,E>` would be `Regular` with a
meaningful not-a-date state created by default.

The authors consider the arguments in [N3527] valid for `optional<T>` and
`expected<T, E>`, however the committee requested that `expected<T, E>` default
constructor should behave as constructed with `T()` if `T` is default
constructible.

## Could `Error` be `void`

`void` isn't a sensible `E` template parameter type: the `expected<T, void>`
vocabularity type means "I expect a `T`, but I may have nothing for you". This
is literally what `optional<T>` is for. If the error is a unit type the user can
use `std::monostate` or `std::nullopt`.

## Conversion from `T`

An object of type `T` is implicitly convertible to an expected object of type
`expected<T, E>`:

```c++
expected<int, errc> ei = 1; // works
```

This convenience feature is not strictly necessary because you can achieve the
same effect by using tagged forwarding constructor:

```c++
expected<int, errc> ei{in_place, 1};
```

It has been demonstrated that this implicit conversion is dangerous
[a-gotcha-with-optional].

An alternative will be to make it explicit and add a `success<T>` (similar to
`unexpected<E>` explicitly convertible from `T` and implicitly convertible to
`expected<T, E>`.

```c++
expected<int, errc> ei = success(1);
expected<int, errc> ej = unexpected(ec);
```

The authors consider that it is safer to have the explicit conversion, the
implicit conversion is so friendly that we don't propose yet an explicit
conversion. In addition `std::optional` has already be delivered in C++17 and it
has this gotcha.

Further, having `success` makes code much more verbose than the current implicit
conversion. Forcing the usage of `success` would make `expected` a much less
useful vocabulary type: if success is expected then success need not be called
out.


## Conversion from `E`

An object of type `E` is not convertible to an unexpected object of type
`expected<T, E>` since `E` and `T` can be of the same type. The proposed
interface uses a special tag `unexpect` and `unexpected` deduction guide to
indicate an unexpected state for `expected<T, E>`. It is used for construction
and assignment. This might raise a couple of objections. First, this duplication
is not strictly necessary because you can achieve the same effect by using the
`unexpect` tag forwarding constructor:

```c++
expected<string, errc> exp1 = unexpected(1);
expected<string, errc> exp2 = {unexpect, 1};
exp1 = unexpected(1);
exp2 = {unexpect, 1};
```

or simply using deduced template parameter for constructors

```c++
expected<string, errc> exp1 = unexpected(1);
exp1 = unexpected(1);
```

While some situations would work with the `{unexpect, ...}` syntax, using
`unexpected` makes the programmer's intention as clear and less cryptic. Compare
these:

```c++
expected<vector<int>, errc> get1() {}
    return {unexpect, 1};
}
expected<vector<int>, errc> get2() {
    return unexpected(1);
}
expected<vector<int>, errc> get3() {
    return expected<vector<int>, int>{unexpect, 1};
}
expected<vector<int>, errc> get2() {
    return unexpected(1);
}
```

The usage of `unexpected` is also a consequence of the adapted model for
`expected`: a discriminated union of `T` and `unexpected<E>`.

## Should we support the `exp2 = {}`?

Note also that the definition of `unexpected` has an explicitly deleted default
constructor. This was in order to enable the reset idiom `exp2 = {}` which would
otherwise not work due to the ambiguity when deducing the right-hand side
argument.

Now that `expected<T, E>` defaults to `T{}` the meaning of `exp2 = {}` is to
assign `T{}`.

## Observers

In order to be as efficient as possible, this proposal includes observers with
narrow and wide contracts. Thus, the `value()` function has a wide contract. If
the expected object does not contain a value, an exception is thrown. However,
when the user knows that the expected object is valid, the use of `operator*`
would be more appropriated.

### Explicit conversion to `bool`

The rational described in [N3672] for `optional<T>` applies to `expected<T,
E>`. The following example therefore combines initialization and value-checking
in a boolean context.

```c++
if (expected<char, errc> ch = readNextChar()) {
// ...
}
```

### `has_value()` following P0032

`has_value()` has been added to follow [P0032R2].

### Accessing the contained value

Even if `expected<T, E>` has not been used in practice for enough time as
`std::optional` or Boost.Optional, we consider that following the same interface
as `std::optional<T>` makes the C++ standard library more homogeneous.

The rational described in [N3672] for `optional<T>` applies to `expected<T, E>`.

### Dereference operator

The indirection operator was chosen because, along with explicit conversion to
`bool`, it is a very common pattern for accessing a value that might not be
there:

```c++
if (p) use(*p);
```

This pattern is used for all sort of pointers (smart or raw) and `optional`; it
clearly indicates the fact that the value may be missing and that we return a
reference rather than a value. The indirection operator created some objections
because it may incorrectly imply `expected` and `optional` are a (possibly
smart) pointer, and thus provides shallow copy and comparison semantics. All
library components so far use indirection operator to return an object that is
not part of the pointer's/iterator's value. In contrast, `expected` as well as
`optional` indirects to the part of its own state. We do not consider it a
problem in the design; it is more like an unprecedented usage of indirection
operator. We believe that the cost of potential confusion is overweighted by the
benefit of an intuitive interface for accessing the contained value.

We do not think that providing an implicit conversion to `T` would be a good
choice. First, it would require different way of checking for the empty state;
and second, such implicit conversion is not perfect and still requires other
means of accessing the contained value if we want to call a member function on
it.

Using the indirection operator for an object that does not contain a value is
undefined behavior. This behavior offers maximum runtime performance.

### Function value

In addition to the indirection operator, we propose the member function `value`
as in [N3672] that returns a reference to the contained value if one exists or
throw an exception otherwise.

```c++
void interact() {
    string s;
    cout << "enter number: ";
    cin >> s;
    expected<int, error> ei = str2int(s);
    try {
        process_int(ei.value());
    }
    catch(bad_expected_access<error>) {
        cout << "this was not a number.";
    }
}
```

The exception thrown is `bad_expected_access<E>` (derived from
`std::exception`) which will contain the stored error.

`bad_expected_access<E>` and `bad_optional_access` could inherit both from a
`bad_access` exception derived from `exception`, but this is not proposed yet.

#### Should `expected<T, E>::value()` throw `E` instead of `bad_expected_access<E>`?

As any type can be thrown as an exception, should `expected<T, E>` throw `E`
instead of `bad_expected_access<E>`?

Some argument that standard function should throw exceptions that inherit from
`std::exception`, but here the exception throw is given by the user via the type
`E`, it is not the standard library that throws explicitly an exception that
don't inherit from `std::exception`.

This could be convenient as the user will have directly the `E`
exception. However it will be more difficult to identify that this was due to a
bad expected access.

If yes, should `optional<T>` throw `nullopt_t` instead of `bad_optional_access`
to be coherent?

We don't propose this.

Other have suggested to throw `system_error` if `E` is `error_code`, rethrow if
`E` is `exception_ptr`, `E` if it inherits from `std::exception` and
`bad_expected_access<E>` otherwise.

An alternative would be to add some customization point that state which
exception is thrown but we don't propose it in this proposal. See the Appendix I.


### Accessing the contained error

Usually, accessing the contained error is done once we know the expected object
has no value. This is why the `error()` function has a narrow contract: it works
only if `*this` does not contain a value.

```c++
expected<int, errc> getIntOrZero(istream_range& r) {
    auto r = getInt(); // won't throw
    if (!r && r.error() == errc::empty_stream) {
        return 0;
    }
    return r;
}
```

This behavior could not be obtained with the `value_or()` method since we want
to return `0` only if the error is equal to `empty_stream`.

We could as well provide an error access function with a wide contract. We just
need to see how to name each one.


### Conversion to the unexpected value

The `error()` function is used to propagate errors, as for example in the next
example:

```c++
expected<pair<int, int>, errc> getIntRange(istream_range& r) {
    auto f = getInt(r);
    if (!f) return unexpected(f.error());
    auto m = matchedString("..", r);
    if (!m) return unexpected(m.error());
    auto l = getInt(r);
    if (!l) return unexpected(l.error());
    return std::make_pair(*f, *l);
}
```


### Function `value_or`

The function member `value_or()` has the same semantics than `optional` [N3672]
since the type of `E` doesn't matter; hence we can consider that `E ==
nullopt_t` and the `optional` semantics yields.

This function is a convenience function that should be a non-member function for
`optional` and `expected`, however as it is already part of the `optional`
interface we propose to have it also for `expected`.


### Equality operators

As for `optional` and `variant`, one of the design goals of `expected` is that
objects of type `expected<T, E>` should be valid elements in STL containers and
usable with STL algorithms (at least if objects of type `T` and `E`
are). Equality comparison is essential for `expected<T, E>` to model concept
`Regular`. C++ does not have concepts yet, but being regular is still essential
for the type to be effectively used with STL.


### Comparison operators

Comparison operators between `expected` objects, and between mixed `expected`
and `unexpected`, aren't required at this time. A future proposal could re-adopt
the comparisons as defined in [P0323R2].


## Modifiers

### Resetting the value

Reseting the value of `expected<T, E>` is similar to `optional<T>` but instead
of building a disengaged `optional<T>`, we build an erroneous `expected<T,
E>`. Hence, the semantics and rationale is the same than in [N3672].


### Tag `in_place`

This proposal makes use of the "in-place" tag as defined in [C++17]. This
proposal provides the same kind of "in-place" constructor that forwards
(perfectly) the arguments provided to `expected`'s constructor into the
constructor of `T`.

In order to trigger this constructor one has to use the tag `in_place`. We need
the extra tag to disambiguate certain situations, like calling `expected`'s
default constructor and requesting `T`'s default construction:

```c++
expected<Big, error> eb{in_place, "1"}; // calls Big{"1"} in place (no moving)
expected<Big, error> ec{in_place}; // calls Big{} in place (no moving)
expected<Big, error> ed{}; // calls Big{} (expected state)
```

### Tag `unexpect`

This proposal provides an "unexpect" constructor that forwards (perfectly) the
arguments provided to `expected`'s constructor into the constructor of `E`. In
order to trigger this constructor one has to use the tag `unexpect`.

We need the extra tag to disambiguate certain situations, notably if `T` and `E`
are the same type.

```c++
expected<Big, error> eb{unexpect, "1"}; // calls error{"1"} in place (no moving)
expected<Big, error> ec{unexpect}; // calls error{} in place (no moving)
```

In order to make the tag uniform an additional "expect" constructor could be
provided but this proposal doesn't propose it.


## Requirements on `T` and `E`

Class template `expected` imposes little requirements on `T` and `E`: they have
to be complete object type satisfying the requirements of `Destructible`. Each
operations on `expected<T, E>` have different requirements and may be disable if
`T` or `E` doesn't respect these requirements. For example, `expected<T, E>`'s
move constructor requires that `T` and `E` are `MoveConstructible`, `expected<T,
E>`'s copy constructor requires that `T` and `E` are `CopyConstructible`, and so
on. This is because `expected<T, E>` is a wrapper for `T` or `E`: it should
resemble `T` or `E` as much as possible. If `T` and `E` are `EqualityComparable`
then (and only then) we expect `expected<T, E>` to be `EqualityComparable`.

However in order to ensure the never empty guaranties, `expected<T, E>` requires
`E` to be no throw move constructible. This is normal as the `E` stands for an
error, and throwing while reporting an error is a very bad thing.


## Expected references

This proposal doesn't include `expected` references as `optional` [C++17]
doesn't include references either.

We need a future proposal.


## Expected `void`

While it could seem weird to instantiate `optional` with `void`, it has more
sense for `expected` as it conveys in addition, as `future<T>`, an error
state. The type `expected<void, E>` means "nothing is expected, but an error
could occur".


## Making expected a literal type

In [N3672], they propose to make `optional` a literal type, the same reasoning
can be applied to expected. Under some conditions, such that `T` and `E` are
trivially destructible, and the same described for `optional`, we propose that
`expected` be a literal type.


## Moved from state

We follow the approach taken in `optional` [N3672]. Moving `expected<T, E>` does
not modify the state of the source (valued or erroneous) of `expected` and the
move semantics is up to `T` or `E`.


## I/O operations

For the same reasons as `optional`[N3672] we do not add `operator<<` and
`operator>> ` I/O operations.


## What happens when `E` is a status?

When `E` is a status, as most of the error codes are, and has more than one
value that mean success, setting an `expected<T, E>` with a successful `e` value
could be misleading if the user expect in this case to have also a `T`. In this
case the user should use the proposed `status_value<E, T>` class. However, if
there is only one value `e` that mean success, there is no such need and
`expected<T, E>` compose better with the monadic interface [P0650R0].


## Do we need an `expected<T, E>::error_or` function?

It has been argued that the error should be always available and that often
there is a success value associated to the error.

`expected<T, E>` would be seen more like something like `struct {E; optional<T>}`.

The following code show a use case

```c++
auto e = function();
switch (e.status())
    success: ....; break;
    too_green: ....; break;
    too_pink: ....; break;
```

With the current interface the user could be tempted to do

```c++
auto e = function();
if (e)
    /*success:*/ ....;
else
    switch (e.error())
    case too_green: ....; break;
    case too_pink: ....; break;
```
    
This could be done with the current interface as follows

```c++
auto e = function();
switch (error_or(e, success))
    success: ....; break;
    too_green: ....; break;
    too_pink: ....; break;
```

where

```c++
template <class E, class T>
E error_or(expected<T, E> const& e, E err) {
    if ( !e ) return err;
    else return e.error();
}
```

Do we need to add such an `error_or` function? as member?

This function should work for all the *ValueOrError* types and so could belong
to a future *ValueOrError* proposal.

Not in this proposal.


## Do we need a `expected<T, E>::check_error` function?

Another use case which could look much uglier is if the user had to test for
whether or not there was a specific error code.

```c++
auto e = function();
while ( e.status == timeout ) {
    sleep(delay);
    delay *=2;
    e = function();
}
```

Here we have a value or a hard error. This use case would need to use something
like `check_error`

```c++
e = function();
while ( check_error(e, timeout) )
{
    sleep(delay);
    delay *=2;
    e = function();
}
```

where

```c++
template <class T, class E>
bool check_error(expected<T, E> const& e, E err) {
    if (e) return false;
    else return e.error()==err;
}
```

Do we want to add such a `check_error` function? as member?

This function should work for all the *ValueOrError* types and so could belong
to a future *ValueOrError* proposal.

Not in this proposal.



## Do we need a `expected<T,G>::adapt_error(function<E(G))` function?

We have the constructor `expected<T, E>(expected<T,G>)` that allows to transport
explicitly the contained error as soon as it is convertible.

However sometimes we cannot change either of the error types and we could need
to do this transformation. This function help to achieve this goal. The
parameter is the function doing the error transformation.

This function can be defined on top of the existing interface.

```c++
template <class T, class E>
expected<T,G> adapt_error(expected<T, E> const& e, function<G(E)> adaptor) {
    if ( !e ) return adaptor(e.error());
    else return expected<T,G>(*e);
}
```

Do we want to add such a `adapt_error` function? as member?

This function should work for all the *ValueOrError* types and so could belong
to a future *ValueOrError* proposal.

Not in this proposal.


# Open points

The authors would like to have an answer to the following points if there is any
interest at all in this proposal:




## What about inherit `bad_expect_access<E>` from `bad_expect_access<void>`?

This has the advantage to make it easier for the user to manage with any bad
access to expected when the user doesn't care of the error.

The same argument can be seen as a bad thing. It is too easy to ignore the
error.

In addition `bad_expect_access<E>` should default the `E` parameter to `void`.

This point was not discussed enough in Toronto. The authors consider that this
should be a correct design.


# Proposed Wording

The proposed changes are expressed as edits to [N4564] the Working Draft - C++

This sub-clause describes class template expected that represents expected
objects. An `expected<T, E>` object is an object that contains the storage for
another object and manages the lifetime of this contained object `T`,
alternatively it could contain the storage for another unexpected object
`E`. The contained object may not be initialized after the expected object has
been initialized, and may not be destroyed before the expected object has been
destroyed. The initialization state of the contained object is tracked by the
expected object.

A program that necessitates the instantiation of template `expected<T, E>` with

Valued instances of `expected<T, E>` where `T` and `E` are of object type shall
contain a value of type `T` or a value of type `E` within its own storage. These
values are referred to as the contained or the unexpected value of the
`expected` object. Implementations are not permitted to use additional storage,
such as dynamic memory, to allocate its contained or unexpected value. The
contained or unexpected value shall be allocated in a region of the `expected<T,
E>` storage suitably aligned for the type `T` and `unexpected<E>`.  Members
`has_val`, `val` and `unexpect` are provided for exposition
only. Implementations need not provide those members. `has_val` indicates
whether the expected object's contained value has been initialized (and not yet
destroyed); when `has_val` is true `val` points to the contained value, and when
it is false `unexpect` points to the erroneous value.

`T` must be `void` or shall be object type and shall satisfy the requirements of
`Destructible` (Table 27).

`E` shall be object type and shall satisfy the requirements of `Destructible` (Table 27).


**X.Z.4.1 Constructors [expected.object.ctor]**

```c++
constexpr expected();
```

*Effects*: Initializes the contained value as if direct-non-list-initializing an
object of type `T` with the expression `T{}` (if `T` is not `void`).

*Postconditions*: `*this` contains a value.

*Throws*: Any exception thrown by the default constructor of `T` (nothing if `T` is `void`).

*Remarks*:  If value-initialization of `T` is a constexpr constructor or `T` is `void` this constructor shall be constexpr. This constructor shall be defined as
deleted unless `is_default_constructible_v<T>` or `T` is `void`.

```

*Effects*: If `rhs` contains a value, initializes the contained value as if
direct-non-list-initializing an object of type `T` with the expression `*rhs` (if `T` is not `void`).

If  `rhs` does not contain a value initializes the contained value as if
direct-non-list-initializing an object of type `unexpected<E>` with the
expression `unexpected(rhs.error())`.

*Postconditions*: `bool(rhs) == bool(*this)`.

otherwise, if `*this` contains a value and `rhs` does not contain a value,

* destroys the contained value by calling `val.~T()` if `T` is not `void`,

If an exception is thrown during the call to `T`'s copy constructor, no effect. If
an exception is thrown during the call to `T`'s copy assignment, the state of its
contained value is as defined by the exception safety guarantee of `T`'s copy
assignment.

# History

## Revision 5 - Revision of [P0323R2] after with feedback from Toronto

The 5th revision of this proposal fixes some typos and takes in account the feedback from Toronto meeting to have wording ready for LWG. JF Bastien co-author this proposal. Next follows the direction of the committee:

* Remove the default value for the `Error` parameter.
* Remove comparison for expected.
* Rename `unexpected_type` and reuse the reserved `unexpected`.
* Remove `make_expected` factory 
* Remove `make_unexpected` factory and make use of deduction guides.
* Remove the helper functions and move them to a future *ValueOrError* proposal.
* Remove `make_expected_from_call`, `make_expected_from_error`.
* Remove `std::hash` specialization.
* Remove  `get_unexpected`.
* `void` is not a valid value for the `Error` parameter.
* Update Open points section.

Other pending changes:

* **TODO** Add the wording for `expected<void,E>` specialization.
* Removed Future Work section.
* Specialize `bad_expected_access<void>`.
* **TODO** Make the wording ready for LWG
 
Other changes proposed by the authors:

* Make `bad_expected_access<E>` inherit from `bad_expected_access<void>`.

## Revision 4 - Revision of [P0323R1] 

The 4th revision of this proposal aligns with the late optional changes, complete the wording ensuring the never empty warranties and fixes some typos. In addition it adds more open points concerning whether `expected<T, E>` must be ordered and implicit conversions. Most of the changes come from suggestion done by Niall and from the feedback of the review of the [Boost.Outcome] library and my understanding of the use cases the [Boost.Outcome] reveal.

Next follows the main modifications:

* Added rvalue overloads for `bad_expected_access::error()` getters and remove the `constexpr`.
* Provide factories that returns `expected<const T, E>`.
* Adapt from late changes in `optional` concerning the observers.
* `get_unexpected()` returns by reference now.
* Allow construction from `expected<U,G>` when the types are convertible.
* Make `bad_expected_access` inherit from `std::exception` instead of from `std::logic_error. 
* Take in account constructor guides.

More open points:

* Consider removing `make_expected_from_call`.
* Consider adding a level on the `bad_expect_access<E>` exception hierarchy.
* Consider changing the default `Error` argument to `error_code`.
* Consider removing the comparison operators and specialize `less<>`.
* Consider `expected<T&, E>`.
* Consider a function that allows to adapt the error transported by `expected`.
* Reconsider expected with a variadic number of errors.

## Revision 3 - Revision of [P0323R0] after with feedback from Oulu

The 3rd revision of this proposal fixes some typos and takes in account the feedback from Oulu meeting. Next follows the direction of the committee:

* Split the proposal on a simple `expected` class and a generic monadic interface.
* As `variant`, `expected` requires some properties in order to ensure the never-empty warranties. As the error type should be no throw movable, we are always sure to be able to ensure the never-empty warranties (Wording **not yet complete**).
* Removed `exception_ptr` specializations as it introduces different behavior, in particular comparisons, exception thrown, ....
* Adapted comparisons to [P0393R3] and consider `T` < `E` to be inline with `variant`.
* Redefined the meaning of `e = {}` as `expected<T, E>` defaults to `T()`.
* Added `const &&` overloads for value getters. 
* Consider to adapt the constructor and assignment from convertible to `T` and `E` to follow last changes in `std::optional` (Wording **not yet complete**).
* Considered making the conversion from the value type explicit and remove the mixed operations to make the interface more robust even if less friendly.
* Removed the future work section.

## Revision 2 - Revision of [N4109] after discussion on the ML

* Fix default constructor to `T`. [N4109] should change the default constructor to `T`, but there were some inconsistencies.
* Complete wording comparison.
* Adapted to last version of referenced proposals.
* Moved alternative designs from open questions to an Appendix.
* Moved already answered open points to a Rationale section.
* Moved open points that can be decided later to a future directions section.
* Complete wording hash.
* Add a section for adapting to `await`.
* Add a section in future work about a possible variadic.
* Fix minor typos.

**Not done yet**

* As `variant`, `expected` requires some properties in order to ensure the never-empty warranties. Add more on never-empty warranties and replace the wording. 


## Revision 1 - Revision of [N4015] after Rapperswil feedback:

* Switch the expected class template parameter order from `expected<E,T>` to `expected<T, E>`.
* Make the unexpected value a salient attribute of the expected class concerning the relational operators.
* Removed open point about making `expected<T, E>` and `expected<T>` different classes.

# Appendix I: Alternative designs

## A Configurable Expected

Expected might be configurable through a trait `expected_traits`. 

The first variation point is the behavior of `value()` when `expected<T, E>` contains an error. 
The current strategy throw a `bad_expected_access` exception but it might not be satisfactory for every error type. 
For example, some might want to encapsulate an `error_code` into a `system_error`. Or in debug mode, they might want to use an `assert` call.

We could as well make the exception thrown depend on the Error overloading a `rethrow_on_unexpected`.


## Which exception throw when the user try to get the expected value but there is none?

It has been suggested to let the user decide the exception that would be throw when the user try to get the expected value but there is none, as third parameter.

While there is no major complexity doing it, as it just needs a third parameter that could default to the
appropriated class,

```c+++
template <class T, class Error, class Exception = bad_expected_access>
struct expected;
```

The authors consider that this is not really needed and that this parameter should not really be part of the type.

The user could use `value_or_throw()`

```c++
expected<int, std::error_code> f();
expected<int, std::error_code> e = f();
auto i = value_or_throw<std::system_error>(e);
```

where

```c++
template <class Exception, class T, class E>
constexpr const T& value_or_throw(expected<T, E> const& e) 
{
    if (!e.has_value())
       throw Exception(e.error());
    return *e;
}
```

A function like this one could be added to the standard, but this proposal doesn't request it.

An alternative is to overload the `value` function with the exception to throw.

```c++
template <class Exception, class T, class E>
constexpr value_type const& value() const&
```

## About `expected<T, ErrorCode, Exception>`

It has been suggested also to extend the design into something that contains

* a `T`, or
* an `ErrorCode`, or
* an `exception_ptr`

This is the case of [Outcome] library.
 
Again there is no major difficulty to implement it, but instead of having one variation point we have two,
that is, is there a value, and if not, if is there an `exception_ptr`.

Better to have a variadic `expected<T, E...>`

# Appendix II: Related types

## Variant

`expected<T, E>` can be seen as a specialization of `boost::variant<unexpected<E>,T>` which gives a specific intent to its first parameter, that is, it represents the type of the expected contained value. This specificity allows to provide a pointer like interface, as it is the case for `std::optional<T>`. Even if the standard included a class `variant<T, E>`, the interface provided by `expected<T, E>` is more specific and closer to what the
user could expect as the result type of a function. In addition, `expected<T, E>` doesn't intend to be used to define recursive data as `boost::variant<>` does.

The following table presents a brief comparison between `boost::variant<unexpected<E>, T>` and `expected<T, E>`.

## Optional

We can see `expected<T, E>` as an `std::optional<T>` that collapse all the values of `E` to `nullopt`.

We can convert an `expected<T, E>` to an `optional<T>` with the possible loss of information.

```c++
template <class T>
optional<T> make_optional(expected<T, E> v) {
    if (v) return make_optional(*v);
    else nullopt;
}
```

We can convert an `optional<T>` to an `expected<T, E>` without knowledge of the root cause. We consider that `E()` is equal to `nullopt` since it shouldn't bring more informations (however it depends on the underlying error — we considered `exception_ptr` and `error_code`).

```c++
template <class E, class T>
expected<T, E> make_expected(optional<T> v) {
    if (v) return *v;
    else unexpected(E());
}
```

The problem is if `E` is a status and `E()` denotes a success value. 

## Promise and Future

We can see `expected<T>` as an always ready `future<T>`. While `promise<>`/`future<>` focuses on inter-thread asynchronous communication, `excepted<T, E>` focus on eager and synchronous computations. We can move a ready `future<T>` to an `expected<T>` with no loss of information.

```c++
template <class T>
expected<T, exception_ptr> make_expected(future<T>&& f) {
    assert (f.ready() && "future not ready");
    try {
        return f.get();
    } catch (...) {
        return unexpected<exception_ptr>{current_exception()};
    }
}
```

We could also create a `future<T>` from an `expected<T>`

```c++
template <class T>
future<T> make_future(expected<T> e) {
    if (e)
        return make_ready_future(*e);
    else
        return make_exceptional_future<T>(e.error());
};
```
